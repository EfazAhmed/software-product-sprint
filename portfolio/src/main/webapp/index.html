      <h2>My Journey in Becoming a Software Engineer</h2>
      <h3>Beginning of my Journey</h3>
      <p>I am a Software Engineer. But, my interests didn't always revolve around Software or programming. 
          Back in 2019, I've always wanted to become a Math Professor. Since Math was my favorite subject at the time, 
          I'd always assumed that my career would be correlated to the field of Mathematics. It wasn't until the year of
          2020, where I took AP CS Java, that sparked my interests in Computer Science. However, 2020 was also the year 
          when the COVID-19 pandemic intially took place. This was a turning point in 
          my career because learning become fully digitalized. After completing AP CS Java, it took it into my own hands
          to teach myself Python for the goal of improving my literacy in programming with respect to DSA and Data Science.</p>
      <h3>From High School to University</h3>
      <p>In transition to becoming a full-time University student, I've picked up a lot of skills using many online resources. 
          But, the most valuable skill that I've learned was, ironically, how to learn. Learning is a skill that I've worked on
          greatly, and allowed me to be blessed with many opportunities regarding Software Engineering early in my career. This 
          involves being the Director of SWE at Baruch AIS, an iOS Technical Program Manager at CodePath, and even participating
          as a Google SPS Participant.
      </p>
      <h3>My Future</h3>
      <p>My aspirations are to become a Googler, while learning extensively about data science. Although I have a lot of enjoyment
          with creating web applications and software, I see myself working as a Data Scientist that creates innovative solutions
          to solve complex problems.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>BobaRun</h3>
      <p>Created a web application game using p5.js for the SG Game Jam 2022. The objective of the game is to
         deliver as many drinks as possible without losing all 3 of your lives.</p>
      <h3>TikTalk</h3>
      <p>Created an Expo/React-Native Application that displays the most popularized TikTok sounds, creators, and has the 
          capability to identify a TikTok sound based on the user's audio input.
      </p>
      <h3>TechDeals</h3>
      <p>Created a Discord bot that allows users to effortlessly locate varieties of optimal and affordable hardware devices
          such as computer hardware and accessories.
      </p>
      <h3>Capture the King</h3>
      <p>Created a virtual chess variant where the objective of the game is to capture the enemy's king without being
          notified of a checkmate before time runs out.
